Polylang adds multilingual support to WordPress. You set a language for each post and it will be displayed only when browsing this language.

== Description ==

You write posts, pages and create categories and post tags as usual, and then define the language for each of them. The translation is optional. A language switcher widget is provided with the plugin. The plugin does not integrate automatic or professional translation. You have to do the work yourself.

= Features =

* You can create as many languages as you want
* You can translate posts, pages, categories, post tags, menus
* RSS feed available for each language
* Support for Search form (see FAQ)
* Support for pretty permalinks
* Support for static page (in the right language) used as front page
* All WordPress default widgets (archives, categories, pages, recent comments, recent posts, tag cloud and calendar) are automatically in the right language 
* Language switcher provided as a widget
* All widgets can be displayed or not, depending on the language (new in 0.3)
* Each user can set the WordPress admin language in its profile (new in 0.4)
* Support for custom post types and custom taxonomies (new in 0.4)

The plugin admin interface is currently available in:

* English
* French
* German
* Russian contributed by [yoyurec](http://wordpress.org/support/profile/yoyurec)

Other translators are welcome ! [Contact me](http://www.flabellina.com/polylang-contact/). I am especially looking for someone who could replace me for the German translation which I did probably very bad...

= Notes =

* The tests have been made with WordPress from version 3.1 up to 3.3 beta 3. The plugin does not work with WordPress 3.0.5 and lower.
* Your server must run PHP5
* Multisite is not supported yet.
* You must deactivate other multilingual plugins before activating Polylang, otherwise, you may get unexpected results !
* Unlike some other plugins, if you deactivate Polylang, your blog will go on working as smoothly as possible. All your posts, pages, category and post tags would be accessible (without language filter of course...).

= Feedback or ideas =

Don't hesitate to [give your feedback](http://wordpress.org/tags/polylang?forum_id=10). It will help making the plugin better. Don't hesitate to rate the plugin too.

== Upgrade Notice ==

Your custom flags in 'polylang/local_flags' directory will be removed when automatically upgrading from v0.4, v0.4.1, v0.4.2. So either do a manual upgrade or backup your custom flags. This problem should be solved when upgrading from v0.4.3 to a higher version.

== Installation ==

1. Download the plugin
1. Extract all the files. 
1. Upload everything (keeping the directory structure) to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
1. Add the 'language switcher' Widget to let your visitors switch the language.
1. Go to the languages settings page and create the languages you need
1. Upload corresponding .mo files in WordPress languages directory (no need for English). You can download it from [here](http://svn.automattic.com/wordpress-i18n/).
1. Take care that your theme must come with the corresponding .mo file too. If your theme is not internationalized yet, please refer to the [codex](http://codex.wordpress.org/I18n_for_WordPress_Developers#I18n_for_theme_and_plugin_developers) or ask the theme author to internationalize it.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why using Polylang and not other well established equivalent plugins ? =

WPML: I tested only the last non-commercial version (2.0.4.1) with WP 3.0.5. The plugin looks quite complete. It's however very heavy (almost 30000 lines of code !). The fact that it has turned commercial is probably adapted to companies or very active bloggers but not well adapted to small blogs.

Xili language: I tested the version 2.2.0. It looks too complex. For example you need to install 3 different plugins to manage post tags translation. If managing post translations is quite easy (and inspired Polylang...), the way to manage categories and post tags translations is not enough user friendly in my opinion. As WPML it's very heavy (about 12000 lines of code).

qtranslate: I tested the version 2.5.23. As claimed by its author, it's probably the best existing plugin... when using it. However, you must know that it is very difficult to come back to a clean site if you deactivate it (as, for example, one post in the database contains all translations). Moreover, it modifies urls so again, if you deactivate it, all links to your internal urls would be broken (not good for SEO).

In comparison to these plugins, Polylang tries to keep things simple and light, and does not mess your blog if you deactivate it. But it is still very young so be indulgent ;-) 

= Where to find help ? =

* A [documentation](http://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/polylang/trunk/doc/documentation-en.pdf) is supplied whith the plugin (look in the doc directory). I spent time to write it so please read it ! A FAQ is available at the end of the document.
* Search the [support forum](http://wordpress.org/tags/polylang?forum_id=10). Other people may had the same issue.
* If you still have a problem, open a new thread in the [support forum](http://wordpress.org/tags/polylang?forum_id=10)

= Is Polylang compatible with multisite ? = 

Not yet. It is planned for v0.5 (to be released before the end of the year)

= Can I use my own flags for the language switcher ? =

Yes. You have to use PNG or JPG files and name them with the WordPress locale. For example, en_US.png. Then upload these files in the `/polylang/local_flags` directory. Don't use the `/polylang/flags` directory as your files may be overwritten when updating the plugin.

= Polylang does not come with a lot flags. Where can I find other flags ? =

There are many sources. I included some of the [famfamfam](http://www.famfamfam.com) flags which I renamed.
